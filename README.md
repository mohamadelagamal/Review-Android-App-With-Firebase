## ü§ñ CI/CD Pipeline

Our automated CI/CD setup ensures every commit is tested and built:

- **Fastlane:** Automates builds, tests, and deployments to the Play Store.
- **Jenkins:** Continuously monitors commits, triggers builds, and performs quality checks.

---

## üõ† Build Types & Flavors

Our project supports versatile build configurations:

### Build Types
- **Debug:** For development and testing.
- **Release:** Optimized for production with code obfuscation and minification.

### Product Flavors
- **Development:** Appended with `.dev` and optimized for local testing.
- **Staging:** For pre-production trials with dedicated settings.
- **Production:** The final release version for end users.

*Example snippet from `build.gradle`:*
```groovy
android {
    buildTypes {
        debug {
            // Debug configuration
        }
        release {
            minifyEnabled true
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android-optimize.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }
    flavorDimensions "version"
    productFlavors {
        development {
            dimension "version"
            applicationIdSuffix ".dev"
            versionNameSuffix "-dev"
        }
        staging {
            dimension "version"
            applicationIdSuffix ".staging"
            versionNameSuffix "-staging"
        }
        production {
            dimension "version"
        }
    }
}
